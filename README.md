# Evangelism

## What does the Node.js Evangelism WG do?
The Evangelism WG creates promotional materials, brings discussions to a wider audience, and attemps to grow the community through positive, supportive messaging.

## Why should you contribute to the Evangelism WG?
The Evangelism WG tries to bring more people into Node, and add to the experience of the ones that are already in it. If you are interested in social media, identity, messaging, writing, or communication, you could be a valuable asset to the WG.
